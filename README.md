# ðŸ“§ AI Based Job Assistant

Itâ€™s like having a personal advisor who helps you with the whole process. It will help you adjust your resume for specific jobs, and even create cover letters that match the tone you need. For example, if youâ€™re sending a cover letter to a company, it can make it sound very professional. But if youâ€™re reaching out to a senior or alumni, it can be more conversational.
This feature is designed to take a huge load off your shoulders, because preparing cover letter for every company is very tiring process

For ME AND many of us, the whole process can become overwhelming, to the point where it affects our mental health. Sometimes, you just need someone to talk to, but itâ€™s not always easy to share your thoughts with mentors or teachers. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re including a chatbot feature in CAREERLINKâ€”a space where you can vent your feelings, seek advice, or just get some supportive words when you need them the most. This feature is designed to help you navigate those tough moments, so you donâ€™t have to carry the burden alone.
